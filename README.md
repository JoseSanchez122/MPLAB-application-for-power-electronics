# MPLAB-application-for-power-electronics
MPLAB application to graph and calculate voltage/current RMS and average using SCR with varying firing angles and loads (resistors, inductors).

## Description
This application provides a GUI to simulate current and voltage across a load using an SCR fired at various AC signal angles. It supports pure resistive, inductive, or mixed (resistive-capacitive) loads. It calculates voltage/current RMS and averages, and displays plots for alpha, gamma, and theta angles, load current, load voltage, and SCR anode-cathode voltage.

## Features
- Simulation of SCR firing at adjustable angles.
- Support for resistive, inductive, and mixed loads.
- Real-time calculation of RMS and average values.
- Detailed plots for angles, load current, and voltages.
